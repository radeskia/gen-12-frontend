# Baby's Food Place Project (Frontend)

*Frontend web application for the recipe blog *


## Short summary

This is the client side design for the final project at Semos Full-Stack Javascript development Academy. Built with React, styled using basic Bootstrap layouts and some CSS styling



## Technologies used and summary

This part of the project main purpose is the mastery and practice of the React library intended for building client-side interfaces, it features the usage of dynamic & reusable components, some minor npm modules, state managment, router play,  HTTP requests...

The styling is done in several different ways (intentional, for practise purposes only) using mainly the Bootstrap library for react, as well as some inline styling of elements and classic external CSS files.

For communication with the backend server im using the module Axios and all the http requests are done asynchronously.

For routing im using the "react-router-dom" module, it's methods for rendering components and it's useHistory hook for redirection purposes.

Some minor modules that are included in the project are the "jwt-decode" which im using to extract the username from a jwt authentication token, and "react-datepicker" for a fancy date selection during user registration.

The most interesting time while building this project was the practice and use of the state managment, use of props, conditional rendering and all the HTTP requests to and from the backend.
